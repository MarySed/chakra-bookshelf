# BOOKSHELF: Next.js, Prisma, and Chakra-UI

Ideally this is going to be a small Goodreads-like personal bookshelf/social media app.
Currently using NextAuth with Github for user registration.

May drop this and use CRA & Knex instead. OPTIONS.

## How To

- Git clone this repo.
- Create a .env file with the following `.env` variables:
  - [ ] DATABASE_URL
  - [ ] GITHUB_ID
  - [ ] GITHUB_SECRET
  - [ ] NEXTAUTH_URL

This repo has no migrations due to compatibility issues between Prisma and Heroku Postgres databases. If you develop this with a local postgres db, you can create migrations lol.

To fill in the `GITHUB` env variables, you'll need to create an OAuth application on Github. You can do that quite easily through the developer settings in your Github account.

You can follow an online guide like [this one](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-use-nextauth-js-for-client-side-authentication-in-next-js/s) to figure out how to fill in both `GITHUB` and `NEXTAUTH` .env variables.

## Thanks üéÄ
